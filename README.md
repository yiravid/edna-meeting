###Make meetings less painful
an Alexa Skill and voice transcription helper

### Why?
Ever had a meeting, when you forgot the key points, got off topic, or somebody was missing?<br />
Edna Meeting listens to your meeting and transcribes who says what.<br />
This makes meetings clear, concise, actionable, and hopefully happen less.<br />
